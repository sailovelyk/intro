        <p class="para">"Hello! I'm Sai from the beautiful coastal city of Visakhapatnam (Vizag), currently pursuing my second year of B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I'm a passionate coder proficient in C, Java, and Python, with hands-on experience building efficient programs and solving real-world problems. I also enjoy full-stack web development, starting strong with HTML (and exploring CSS + JS to create clean, responsive interfaces). Whether it's diving into algorithms, experimenting with AI concepts, or crafting simple yet powerful websites, I love turning ideas into code. Let's connect and build something awesome together!" <br><hr>
